EmployeeWebApllication. More about every task:<br>

 - CRUD was used for model Employee. While employee controller has  Read, Update and Delete methods, <br>
for Create method additional EmployeeService was created since im creating Employees when someone registers.<br>
Also Delete method only deletes Employee, but not the related User this creates some errors.<br>
<br>
 - For list filtering and paging im using jQuery datatables. List can only be viewed by admin and manager at /Employee/Read<br>
<br>
 - When Employee is created his incom is set to 0. Only admin can change this. Admin and manager can see both Income and Gross Income in /Employee/Read<br>
Any simple user trying to accses /Employee/Read will be redirected to /Employee/Details where the user can view his own salary.<br>
<br>
 - Admin can edit employees income. Typing in a value and then clicking away will show how tax adds up. <br>
In Employee/Read and Employee/Details required values are calculated in controller and then passed to the view.<br>
<br>
 - Database use only one additional model Employee who has first name, last name, income, image path and user id.<br>
<br>
